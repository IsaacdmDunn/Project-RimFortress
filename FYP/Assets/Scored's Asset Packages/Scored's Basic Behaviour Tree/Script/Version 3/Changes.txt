Version 2 => Version 3 Changes:
- Removed ScriptableObject version as its not compatible with the main focus of this version
  which is Coroutines. (it may return but I have not learned properly yet how to use it)
- struct LeafState under MonoLeaf is now class ExecuteState under MonoNodeBase.
- Extensive Refactors to accomidate IEnumerator types. Overall structure is mostly the same.
